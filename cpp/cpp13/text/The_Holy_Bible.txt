1in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters  
7	and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so  
8	and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day  
9 	and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so  
10	and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good  
11	and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so  
12	and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
	and the evening and the morning were the third day  
and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years  
15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so  
16	and god made two great lights  the greater light to rule the day  and the lesser light to rule the night   he made  the stars also  
17	and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  
18	and to rule over the day and over the night  and to divide the light from the darkness  and god saw that  it was  good  
19	and the evening and the morning were the fourth day  
20 	and god said  let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life  and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven  
21	and god created great whales  and every living creature that moveth  which the waters brought forth abundantly  after their kind  and every winged fowl after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
22	and god blessed them  saying  be fruitful  and multiply  and fill the waters in the seas  and let fowl multiply in the earth  
23	and the evening and the morning were the fifth day  
24 	and god said  let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind  cattle  and creeping thing  and beast of the earth after his kind  and it was so  
25	and god made the beast of the earth after his kind  and cattle after their kind  and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
26 	and god said  let us make man in our image  after our likeness  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over the cattle  and over all the earth  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  
27	so god created man in his  own  image  in the image of god created he him  male and female created he them  
28	and god blessed them  and god said unto them  be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth  and subdue it  and have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth  
29 	and god said  behold  i have given you every herb bearing seed  which  is  upon the face of all the earth  and every tree  in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed  to you it shall be for meat  
30	and to every beast of the earth  and to every fowl of the air  and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth  wherein  there is  life   i have given  every green herb for meat  and it was so  
31 	and god saw every thing that he had made  and  behold   it was  very good  and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
